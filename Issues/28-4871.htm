<br> AUTHOR: Abraham Solomonick<br> TITLE: From Semiotics towards Philosophical Metaphysics<br> PUBLISHER: Cambridge Scholars Publishing<br> YEAR: 2017<br> <br> REVIEWER: Kristin Terrill, Iowa State University<br> <br> REVIEWS EDITOR: Helen Aristar-Dry<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>Over
 a century after the death of its most recognized founder, Ferdinand de 
Saussure, semiotics can hardly be conceived as a burgeoning science. 
Yet, as Daniel Chandler wryly notes in his primer, ‘Semiotics: The 
Basics’: “If you go into a bookshop and ask an assistant where to find a
 book on semiotics, you are likely to meet with a blank look. Even 
worse, you might be asked to define what semiotics is – which would be a
 bit tricky if you were looking for a beginner’s guide. It’s worse still
 if you do know a bit about semiotics, because it can be hard to offer a
 simple definition which is of much use in the bookshop. If you’ve ever 
been in such a situation, you’ll probably agree that it’s wise not to 
ask. Semiotics could be anywhere” (Chandler, 2007). Situated 
uncomfortably between anthropology, linguistics, and philosophy, 
semiotics retains a reputation as arcane, if not abstruse. A doctor of 
applied linguistics, Abraham Solomonick has, in his late career, taken 
on the mantle of a semiotician. He believes that establishing semiotics 
as a scientific pursuit in its own right, rather than as a topic of 
interest in philosophy or a sub-field for scholars in other branches of 
science, will make it more useful for empirical research and thus, less 
bemusing to bookshop owners. <br><br>In his first English-language book,
 ‘A Theory of General Semiotics,’ Solomonick proposed a model for 
analyzing signs and sign-systems that could be applied universally, i.e.
 to any exploration of meaning and communication, regardless of its 
nature or purpose. In this follow-up monograph, titled ‘From Semiotics 
towards Philosophical Metaphysics,’ Solomonick diverts his attention 
from science to philosophy, and explores the potential contributions of 
the science of semiotics to questions of metaphysics. The motivation for
 this book, as Solomonick explains in the preface, is to situate his 
general theory relative to existing semiotic frameworks. The key element
 that differentiates Solomonick’s theory from the major theorists in 
this field (Solomonick specifically references Ferdinand de Saussure, 
Charles W. Morris, and Charles S. Pierce) is the construct of “semiotic 
reality,” or “the sum total of all the signs and sign-systems that have 
been produced by humanity throughout its existence.” The chief purpose 
of this book, which is comprised of 12 essays, is to expand on the idea 
of ‘semiotic reality’ and to show how it both informs and is understood 
through Solomonick’s semiotic framework. Readers invested in semiotics 
and the trajectory of its evolution may find this book of interest, 
especially those in search of a scientific theoretical framework for 
situating their semiotics research.<br><br>This book is presented in 3 
parts, in which Solomonick revises his theory of general semiotics in 
terms of his metaphysical outlook. The first section presents a detailed
 explanation of his semiotic framework, which can be summarized as (a) 
the basic constructs of semiotics, (b) the hierarchical taxonomy of 
signs and sign-systems, and (c) the metaphysical premise of 4 realities,
 the latter of which is the major topic covered in the second section. 
In Solomonick’s framework, the three basic dimensions of semiotics are 
the sign, the sign-system, and semiotic activity. The sign is elemental:
 any conveyance of meaning can be construed as a sign, from a falling 
leaf, to a word, to a lunar map. Here, it is defined in relation to 
definitions previously proposed by Saussure and Pierce, and I discuss 
the distinction in detail in my evaluation. Sign-systems are 
systematically organized groups of signs that function in relation to 
one another, for instance, a language. Semiotic activity is the 
functioning of signs and sign-systems. The hierarchical taxonomy of 
signs is a framework for classifying signs in terms of their 
abstractness. Finally, the 4 realities—ontological (all that exists 
independent of humanity), semiotic (defined above), mental, and 
virtual—are the loci among which semiotic activity mediates information.<br><br>In
 the third and final section, Solomonick deals with practical 
applications and contextual information. This section is comprised of 2 
essays in which Solomonick applies his framework to examinations of 
semiotics in science and cartography, respectively, an “illustrated 
biography,” and a narrative summary of the effects Solomonick’s theories
 have had on the academic world to date. <br><br>EVALUATION<br><br>Solomonick’s
 framework is grounded in the foundational texts of semiotics with 
additional elements related to his proposed metaphysical model. For 
instance, his conception of the ‘sign’ elaborates on his readings of 
Pierce and Saussure. Saussure’s dyadic model posits that a sign consists
 of two parts: ‘signifier’ (a formal symbol) and ‘signified’ (a 
concept), both of which are conceived as mental constructs, whereas 
Pierce’s triadic model includes three components: ‘representamen’ (a 
formal symbol), ‘object’ (that which the symbol stands for), and 
‘interpretant’ (the sense made of the sign by a person) (Chandler, 
2007). Just as Pierce’s triadic model of a sign was more complex, both 
conceptually and philosophically, than Saussure’s dyadic model, 
Solomonick’s 4-part model incorporates one additional element into 
Pierce’s framework: the sign’s ‘social recognition.’ Solomonick proposes
 that in addition to acting as mediators between people and the world 
around them, signs also mediate between individuals and society. Through
 this model, Solomonick introduces his metaphysical theory of a 
‘semiotic reality’: “Within [Pierce’s model] we form our signs and our 
mental ideas by direct contact with the outside world, but within [the 
additional element] we do so through social experience – through the 
interpretation of the entire body of cultural heritage that we receive 
through contact with humanity, including what we hear from other people,
 glean from our education and from reading books, etc. In the long run, 
our ideas appear to be nurtured from both of these sources, but the 
second source definitely prevails over the first. That is why its 
addition to the model of the sign is completely justified” (Solomonick, 
2017). This extension of the sign model is perhaps more relevant to 
Solomonick’s metaphysical theories than to his scientific taxonomy of 
semiotics; however, the notion of semiotic reality is incorporated 
throughout the entire book.<br><br>Solomonick’s major innovation in the 
science of semiotics is a hierarchical taxonomy of sign types and 
sign-systems. This taxonomy was introduced in his earlier monograph, but
 its re-introduction here provides ground for Solomonick to build a case
 for semiotic reality through his general framework. The lowest level of
 the hierarchy is natural sign-systems (natural signs being the basic 
unit for this system), followed by iconic sign-systems (images), 
language sign-systems (words), notational sign-systems (graphemes), 
formalized sign systems of the first order (symbols with fixed meaning, 
such as arithmetic symbols), and formalized systems of the second order 
(symbols with ad hoc meaning, such as algebraic symbols). The hierarchy 
for this taxonomy is based on the signs’ degree of abstractness, a 
concept that Solomonick explores in detail in his essay on ‘visuality.’ 
‘Visuality’ is defined as taking form as a mental or conceptual 
representation. The degree of abstractness can also be understood as a 
relationship among the formal symbol, the mental representation, and the
 object or concept they relate to. For instance, natural signs, such as 
the changing color of the sky before sunrise, are literally visual and 
are a part of ontological reality; they require no socialization or 
intentionality to have meaning. Linguistic signs (words), by contrast, 
are arbitrary and depend on social convention to have meaning. Likewise,
 signs in formalized systems, e.g. mathematical symbols, take on meaning
 through social conventions. These are further removed from ontological 
reality than language, because they are deliberately designed by people 
and because to understand these sign-systems requires special training 
and/or advanced intellect. Formalized signs convey meaning more 
efficiently than images, words, or graphemes can. Concepts in formalized
 sign-systems may also be extremely abstract, complex, or theoretical, 
and thus the ‘visuality’ of these signs occurs when people construct 
meaning from other concepts rather than through direct interaction with 
ontological reality. For the most part, this process is facilitated by 
social interaction.<br><br>Solomonick seems unwilling to reject the 
social constructivist viewpoint that informs Saussure’s semiotics, i.e. 
the assumption that conceptual meanings originate in social conventions 
rather than in essential, a priori truths. Solomonick’s theory of 
multiple realities could be construed as a middle ground between realism
 and constructivist epistemology (the philosophy that knowledge of the 
world is socially constructed and, therefore, open to interpretation); 
he believes that signs and sign-systems not only convey what is known 
about ontological reality, but also that the forms of signs and 
sign-systems can be seen as evidence of the nature of both ontological 
and semiotic realities. An elegant example Solomonick returns to 
repeatedly throughout the book is the periodic table of elements, a 
sign-system designed by Mendeleyev to represent a theory of chemistry. 
At the time of its introduction, the periodic table was used to predict 
the discovery of elements based on logical deduction that the new sign 
system made possible. Thus, the value of semiotics as a branch of 
science, according to Solomonick, is that sign-systems have the 
potential to reveal knowledge that would not be apparent through other 
means of investigation. Solomonick’s model of semiotics is formulated as
 a sign-system precisely because sign-systems can be used to generate 
new theories—not only do they convey concepts, they also provide a 
unique type of evidence about the nature of both ontological and 
semiotic reality. <br><br>Differentiating between ontological reality 
and semiotic reality places Solomonick firmly in the realm of 
realism/logical positivism, i.e. the philosophy that knowledge has roots
 in an objective reality. The stated purpose of this book is to explain 
and explore the construct of semiotic reality, and the collected essays 
do explain how this construct underpins his theoretical framework at 
different levels. His exploration of the relationship between 
ontological and semiotic reality is more developed than his introduction
 of the 4-reality model, however. Ultimately, Solomonick will need to 
provide further support for the propositions of ‘mental’ and ‘virtual’ 
realities. These components of his framework are discussed briefly in 
the end of the second part of the book, and it is unclear what 
differentiates either the mental or the virtual from the semiotic. 
Perhaps this clarification will be the topic of future works. <br><br>On
 the whole, Solomonick accomplishes what he sets out to do, which is to 
propose a means of pursuing semiotics as a science in its own right, and
 provides a philosophical basis for the framework that is inclusive of 
multiple viewpoints. Disregarding the inherent value of Solomonick’s 
theories, however, some critical flaws in the book damage the author’s 
credibility. Most importantly, the references for this book are provided
 in a disorganized, haphazard manner. For instance, Solomonick does not 
provide a bibliographic reference for an in-text citation of a book 
called ‘Basics of Geometry’ by D. Gilbert. Searching both WorldCat and 
Amazon.com failed to yield any results for this title; perhaps this 
in-text citation is an English translation of the title of a Hebrew or 
Russian textbook. The “Illustrated Bibliography” chapter does not 
contain a complete list of referenced works, and also is missing the 
illustrations. Not all of Solomonick’s in-text references are 
accompanied by footnotes, and some footnotes are merely web page 
addresses (URLs) with no author or copyright information. Moreover, many
 of the web pages cited have been taken off the web since the 
publication of this book. Finally, some of the claims made to support 
Solomonick’s arguments are not themselves supported with evidence; an 
early example of this occurs when he lays out the theoretical basis for 
the order of the hierarchical taxonomy: “Thus, increased abstractness of
 various types of signs goes hand in hand with their becoming more 
remote from their referents and with their escalating level of 
generalization. This seems to be the decisive factor in the creation of 
increasingly abstract signs and sign-systems in the history of our 
development as Homo sapiens.” No anthropological evidence is provided 
for the claim that signs and sign-systems become increasingly abstract 
throughout history; it remains an unsubstantiated assumption that 
underlies the structure of his framework.<br><br>Solomonick also claims 
in places that no literature exists on a topic, even when these claims 
are easily disputed. For instance, in his essay on ‘visuality,’ he 
writes, “Not a single monograph is devoted to [visuality as a 
philosophical entity], to visuality’s general and most significant 
sense. Not a single philosophical article deals with the applicability 
of visuality under different conditions and hypostases” (2017). Yet a 
cursory database search reveals several such monographs, including 
general explorations of visuality by Beate Allert (1996), Hagi Kenaan 
(2013), and Michael Leja (2000), to name just a few. Editorial 
oversights of this nature detract from the usability of this book as a 
scholarly resource. Its clear, straightforward style and provocative 
subject matter make for compelling reading, however, and it adds a 
philosophical basis to the theoretical framework established in 
Solomonick’s earlier book.<br><br>REFERENCES<br><br>Allert, Beate (ed.).
