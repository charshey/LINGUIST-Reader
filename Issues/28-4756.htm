<br> AUTHOR: Piotr Romanowski<br> TITLE: Intercultural Communicative Competence in English Language Teaching in Polish State Colleges<br> PUBLISHER: Cambridge Scholars Publishing<br> YEAR: 2017<br> <br> REVIEWER: Tünde Bajzát, University of Miskolc<br> <br> REVIEWS EDITOR: Helen Aristar-Dry<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>The
 book entitled “Intercultural Communicative Competence in English 
Language Teaching in Polish State Colleges” was written by Piotr 
Romanowski. It constitutes seven chapters: the first three chapters 
present the theoretical background of culture, communication and 
intercultural communicative competence (ICC); the fourth and fifth 
chapters deal with the approaches and techniques of developing ICC; and 
the last two chapters show the results of the empirical studies carried 
out in Polish State Colleges. The ’Introduction’ explains the book’s 
focus and organization, and briefly describes each chapter.<br><br>The 
first chapter of the book is entitled ‘Culture and Communication in the 
Light of Intercultural Studies’ and it first discusses the history of 
intercultural communication (IC). The author traces the origins of IC 
back to the 5th century BC to Herodotus and describes its development 
after the Second World War in the USA. And then he compares and 
contrasts the factors and reasons why IC could develop in the USA, but 
could not in Eastern and Central Europe. We learn how anthropology, 
sociology and pragmatics helped the development of IC, while reading 
about the most important scholars, organizations and publications of the
 field. Research studies and the teaching of IC started in the 1990s in 
Poland, the details of which are presented in the chapter. After that 
the concept of culture is discussed from different perspectives; and the
 Whorf/Sapir hypothesis, and the definitions of such scholars as Clyde 
Kluckhohn and Florence Strodtbeck, Deborah Peck, Geert Hofstede, H. 
Douglas Brown, Patrick Moran, and William B. Gudykunst are described in 
detail. Then the impact of culture on IC is shown by introducing the 
ideas of Jerzy Mikułowski-Pomorski, Laray M. Barna, William B. Gudykunst
 and Young Y. Kim, Claire Kramsch, and Anna Lubecka. At the end of the 
chapter Geert Hofstede’s classification of cultural values and Edward T.
 Hall’s concepts of high- versus low-context cultures and polychronic 
versus monochronic time orientations are described in detail.<br><br>Chapter
 Two, entitled ‘Language and Intercultural Communication’ first defines 
language as a basic means of interpersonal communication by discussing 
the definitions of pre-interculturalist scholars, such as Edward Sapir, 
Bernard Bloch, George L. Trager, Edward T. Hall, and Noam Chomsky. The 
author concludes this discussion by stating that language was designed 
for the purpose of communication, and IC researchers always study 
language usage and its functions. Then he reviews the models of 
communication and discusses the ideas of the two main schools in the 
study of communication. One of them views communication as the 
transmission of messages, and the other sees it as the production and 
exchange of meanings. After that the author describes how English became
 the language of global communication in all fields of our lives in the 
past fifty years. Finally, the chapter closes with emphasizing the role 
of English as the global lingua franca and its crucial importance in 
intercultural communication. <br><br>‘From Linguistic Competence to 
Intercultural Communicative Competence’ is the title of the third 
chapter and it starts with briefly describing how the concepts and types
 of competence varied between the 1960s and 2000. Then it continues with
 discussing the evolutionary stages of competences from the viewpoint of
 language teaching methodology. First, the concept of linguistic 
competence is introduced based on the theories of Noam Chomsky, 
Ferdinand de Saussure, and John Lyons. Then sociolinguistic competence 
is described with the help of Dell Hymes’ ideas, leading to the 
discussion of Michael Canale’s model containing four sub-competences: 
grammatical, sociolinguistic, discourse and strategic competences. The 
next part of the chapter deals with the theories of communicative 
competence defined by the models of Brian H. Spitzberg, Joan Rubin, 
James McCroskey, Daniel Canary and Michael Cody, and Wilga Marie Rivers.
 After that ICC and its components are discussed. The author states that
 ICC has been the focus of several studies since the 1960s, and ICC 
involves the knowledge, motivation, and skills that enable us to 
communicate effectively and appropriately with people from different 
cultures. Since then research studies have been carried out by Brent D. 
Ruben, Mitchell R. Hammer, William B. Gudykunst and Richard L. Wiseman, 
Stella Ting-Toomey, Brian H. Spitzberg, Young Y. Kim, and M. J. Collier 
by applying different approaches to ICC. Finally, the chapter describes 
in detail the stages of Milton J. Bennett’s Developmental Model of 
Intercultural Sensitivity, and the author finishes this section by 
concluding that intercultural sensitivity is the key variable accounting
 for success in IC. <br><br>Chapter Four – ‘Intercultural Approach in 
Language Education’ – highlights the role of IC in learning and teaching
 foreign languages by discussing three approaches, namely ethnographic, 
experiential, and comparative. In language learning the ethnographic 
approach concentrates on the observation and description of the 
behaviours of people from a given culture, and it helps to develop the 
learners’ mediating competences. On the other hand, during experiential 
learning students themselves contribute to their own language learning 
as they are actively involved in the process; they gain immediate 
personal experiences of language, communication and culture. The 
comparative approach helps learning by urging students to make 
comparisons between the target culture and their own. The author closes 
the chapter by describing some of the opportunities, challenges and 
difficulties of developing ICC in the classroom and concludes by 
stressing the importance of developing ICC in the foreign language 
classroom, because it offers an opportunity to prepare students for 
their future intercultural encounters. <br><br>The fifth chapter is 
entitled ‘Techniques for Developing Intercultural Communicative 
Competence’ and describes five techniques (simulation games, case 
studies, critical incidents, role plays, and culture assimilators) to 
help students acquire intercultural skills in an active and authentic 
way. Simulation games allow students to engage in genuine communication 
while they are learning a foreign language. They can also try out new 
behaviours in the safe environment of the classroom; and with the help 
of the simulated life-like problems they can develop their 
critical-thinking and problem-solving skills as well. The case study 
technique helps students to develop their cognitive skills, such as 
analysis and decision making. They learn to identify and solve problems 
deriving from intercultural differences, and make decisions while paying
 attention to different cultural perspectives and their consequences. 
The aim of critical incidents is to confront students with difficult 
problems or conflict situations they may come across in IC in order to 
increase their understanding of cultural diversity. Role plays help 
students to build interpersonal skills. The culture assimilator (also 
called intercultural sensitizer) uses a series of scenarios containing 
some elements of cultural clash or misunderstanding in order to prepare 
students to interact effectively with people from different cultures. 
The chapter not only describes each of the techniques, but also gives 
example exercises. <br><br>In Chapter Six, ‘Investigating the 
Intercultural Communicative Competence of Polish Students of English’, 
the author focuses on the context, objectives and methodology of the 
empirical research he carried out at Polish State Colleges. First, he 
describes the IC course, which aims at developing full-time English 
major students’ ICC in the last (third) year of their studies. The 
course contains 30 contact hours and a wide range of topics, starting 
with a short historical overview, followed by the most fundamental 
concepts in IC. Then students learn about cultural diversity, how to 
develop an ethnorelative attitude, the role of stereotypes, the concepts
 of multiculturalism, the process of communication and its basic models,
 the notion of sociolect and idiolect, the verbal and non-verbal 
components of IC, and political correctness. In order to make the course
 more efficient the lectures are interactive, and the theoretical 
approaches are supplemented with case studies and simulation games. 
After the detailed description of the course, the aims of the research 
study are defined. One of the aims was to measure the level of ICC of 
the students of English Philology at four Polish Colleges before and 
after attending the IC course offered at the institutions. The other 
goal was to create a cultural profile of the Polish intercultural 
communicator, who is a student of English. The empirical research was 
inspired by the research studies into intercultural sensitivity 
conducted by Milton J. Bennett, Guo-Ming Chen and William J. Starosta, 
and Wolfgang Fritz and Antje Moellenberg, and the author designed a tool
 to measure intercultural sensitivity. The most often applied research 
methods of IC were used, namely self-reflection, participant 
observation, qualitative interviews and questionnaires. Then the 
questionnaire used in the study and the research design are presented in
 detail. At the end of the chapter the author gives a detailed 
description of the four Polish institutions where the study was 
conducted, and pays special attention to the multicultural character of 
the towns. <br><br>The last chapter, entitled ‘Findings of the 
Investigation’ describes the outcomes of the research. At the four 
institutions altogether 150 students participated in the study and the 
results proved that before taking part in the IC course the participants
 highly respected the values and opinions of people from other cultures,
 but they needed to focus on improving their openness and to learn how 
to use verbal and non-verbal cues effectively; their low level of 
confidence in intercultural encounters was also detected. After 
completing the IC course the findings showed that the students’ positive
 attitudes towards intercultural differences increased significantly, 
which proves that the participants improved their skills and became more
 open, friendly and sensitive towards strangers in intercultural 
encounters; also their understanding and respect of otherness increased.
 Furthermore, they could adapt their behaviour more easily and 
effectively, their confidence in communication grew stronger and their 
willingness to engage in intercultural interactions heightened 
significantly. As far as the culture-specific profile of the students is
 concerned the outcomes of the research proved that before participating
 in the IC course ethnocentrism was the characteristic feature of the 
Polish students, and they displayed denial, lack of interest and 
avoidance of intercultural encounters. At the interviews they also 
admitted lacking intercultural knowledge, skills and attitudes, which 
accounts for their fears, uncertainty, low self-confidence and high risk
 avoidance. However, after completing the IC course a shift to 
ethnorelativism, a positive change in intercultural sensitivity and 
self-confidence could be observed. The results of the course evaluation 
questionnaire revealed that all students found the IC course highly 
effective, they expressed positive opinions, and they became motivated 
to pursue their studies of IC further. <br><br>The ‘Conclusion’ 
summarizes the most important findings of the empirical research. The 
‘Bibliography’ section closes the book by listing the used English and 
Polish scientific literature on seventeen pages.<br><br>EVALUATION<br><br>The
 book offers a theoretical overview of culture, communication, 
intercultural communicative competence and the development of ICC and 
the findings of the empirical studies carried out at four Polish State 
Colleges. <br><br>One of the major strengths of the book is that it 
contributes to the field of intercultural communication by providing a 
well-discussed and detailed theoretical background of IC and its 
development. It is an outstanding book, because the author included the 
works of Polish scholars, and several elements and examples of Polish 
language and culture. The book is a unique combination of theory, 
practice and research results. Also, the bibliography at the end of the 
book offers the reader ample opportunities to further explore the topic,
 which is another merit of the book. The tables and figures in the book 
not only help understanding the described details but also make the book
 look more attractive, interesting and enjoyable to read. <br><br>Besides
 the above-mentioned advantages, the book is useful for foreign language
 teachers, practitioners and educators of IC because they can find 
several approaches, techniques, and practical examples they can employ 
in their everyday teaching, and by adopting them they can raise their 
students’ motivation, make their classes more interesting and help their
 students’ to further develop their linguistic and intercultural 
competences. <br><br>The book is essential for scholars and researchers 
of linguistics interested in intercultural communicative competence 
development, because of its strong theoretical background providing 
several examples of scientific literature and the detailed description 
of the empirical research and its findings, which will inspire thinking,
 theorizing and action. As it is suggested in the book one aspect of 
further research can be to carry out the same research at other 
institutions in the world and compare the results; another angle can be 
to carry it out among students studying at other Faculties of higher 
education and compare the research findings. <br>In short, the book 
written by Piotr Romanowski is a worthwhile read and welcome addition to
 our body of knowledge on intercultural communicative competence and its
 development. At the same time it is an important contribution to the 
fast-evolving field of Intercultural Communication Studies. The book is 
of manageable size and scope, clearly worded, interesting, useful and 
opens new avenues for future research and study.<br><br> <br> ABOUT THE REVIEWER<br> <br>
