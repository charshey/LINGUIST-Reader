<br> EDITOR: Alicia Pousada<br> TITLE: Being Bilingual in Borinquen<br> SUBTITLE: Student Voices from the University of Puerto Rico<br> PUBLISHER: Cambridge Scholars Publishing<br> YEAR: 2017<br> <br> REVIEWER: Hannah M King, Birkbeck, University of London, UK<br> <br> REVIEWS EDITOR: Helen Aristar-Dry<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>“Being
 Bilingual in Borinquen,” edited by Alicia Pousada, is a collection of 
25 linguistic autobiographies written by graduate students at the 
University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus. The book seeks to 
highlight the experiences of these Puerto Rican students as they have 
developed their high level linguistic competences in multiple languages 
and cultures. Furthermore, the volume endeavors to identify variables 
and characteristics within the narratives that have contributed to the 
participants’ highly developed English and Spanish skills, to aid future
 language planning and policy. Aimed at teachers and language 
professionals, the book is structured into five chapters. The first 
chapter provides a basic introduction to the topic of bilingualism as it
 relates to the linguistic situation on the island. The second through 
fourth chapters showcase a collection of narratives grouped by shared 
bilingual experiences: those born in Puerto Rico, Nuyoricans and early 
childhood bilinguals, and immigrants to the island, respectively. 
Finally, Chapter 5 poses the question, “What’s It All Mean?”<br><br>In 
Chapter 1, “Who’s Bilingual and Why?”, the author provides a brief 
introduction to the language situation in Puerto Rico (otherwise known 
as Borinquen). A lack of mastery of the English language is noted even 
though being bilingual is, in theory, viewed as advantageous; a reality 
that may relate to resistance towards imposed language rules and 
regulations. Pousada next highlights some basic concepts in bilingualism
 research starting with a look at various definitions of the term 
itself. She settles on the idea that bilingualism is “dynamic and 
ever-changing,” particularly within the students’ narratives. A summary 
of different types of bilingualism follows, connecting the categories 
with examples of how Puerto Ricans may fall into these various 
definitions. It is noted that due to the requirement of studying English
 as a subject in school, most Puerto Ricans are “sequential, late 
childhood bilinguals” (p. 7); however there is a range of bilingual 
‘types’ represented in the autobiographies. Pousada gives an 
introductory nod to successful language learning, citing Spolsky’s 
(1989) model as a way to highlight the connections between social 
context, attitudes, and personal characteristics. She links the ‘social 
context’ of the model with language policy and class in Puerto Rico, 
cites jobs, travel, and English-media as sources of ‘motivation,’ and 
notes that ‘personal characteristics’ are extremely varied within the 
provided narratives. <br><br>Chapter 1 next touches on growing up and 
living as a multilingual, mentioning that multilingual societies are 
common and often less focused on the goal of speaking like a ‘native,’ 
while speakers in Puerto Rico and other societies with a history of 
imposed language use can be reluctant to learn a language or have 
negative attitudes towards a way of speaking. Societal versus individual
 bilingualism is discussed to make the important distinction between 
bilingual individuals as speakers that can utilize multiple language 
varieties and situations of societal bilingualism in which the 
government or education system may require or protect a language or 
languages. Pousada goes on to discuss languages in contact in Puerto 
Rico, providing an abbreviated discussion on borrowing of English words 
into the local Spanish, code-switching as a part of Puerto Rican 
bilingual identity, and dynamic translanguaging within the linguistic 
repertoires of these students.<br><br>The second chapter, “Made in 
Puerto Rico,” highlights the autobiographies of 10 students who have 
lived the majority of their lives in Puerto Rico, were educated in 
Spanish-medium schools, and spoke Spanish at home as children. 
Interestingly, although only half of the authors consider themselves to 
be Spanish-dominant, they all spoke of the prominence of English media 
and entertainment throughout their lives–whether that be TV shows, 
films, books, or music. Pousada allows the stories to speak for 
themselves in Chapters 2-4, withholding commentary until the final 
chapter.<br><br>Chapter 3, entitled “Nuyoricans and Other Early 
Childhood Bilinguals,” tells the stories of 12 individuals who were 
either born in the USA (5 out of 10) or had at least one 
English-speaking (therefore bilingual) parent. The majority of these 
students travelled back and forth between the USA and Puerto Rico (and 
sometimes additional countries) during their childhood and/or 
adolescence. These bilinguals, like those from the previous chapter, 
frequently brought up the prevalence of English media in their lives, 
and a number of them had knowledge of a third, fourth, or even fifth 
language.<br><br>In the fourth chapter, “Immigrants to the Enchanted 
Island,” we discover the histories of just three individuals, all three 
born in the USA, who moved to Puerto Rico as adults. Two of these 
English-dominant students had monolingual parents, learned Spanish in 
school, and traveled in Spanish-speaking countries.<br><br>In Chapter 5,
 entitled “What’s It All Mean?”, Pousada discusses the fact that 
although the linguistic situation in Puerto Rico has been studied by 
educators, linguists, and social scientists, the key voices missing are 
those of the people who have directly experienced bi- or multilingualism
 on the island. The analysis begins with a list of the commonalities 
between the narratives, including factors such as supportive adults, 
opportunities for language acquisition, awareness of the benefits of 
bilingualism, non-judgmental attitudes, personal relationships that gave
 a purpose to language learning, flexibility and openness, and the 
inclination to take social risks. The speakers also tend to agree that 
being bilingual is advantageous. The main distinguishing features of the
 stories are then identified as types and lengths of schooling, family 
structure, and differences in community.<br><br>Pousada then turns to 
the topic of language policy in Puerto Rico and gives an introduction 
and brief history of the language policies of the island, noting that 
these policies rarely take into consideration the needs of speakers and 
their diversity, but rather serve political agendas. Although Spanish 
operates at the ‘de facto’ language of Puerto Rico, there have been 
numerous language policies put into place over the years, from 
co-official status for Spanish and English, to Spanish as the official 
language and back again. Connecting the stories with language planning 
possibilities, Pousada claims that the characteristics shared across 
narratives that helped the students become ‘successful’ are required 
throughout the island, arguing that an “ideal” language policy would 
understand the benefits of bilingualism and provide opportunities for 
acquisition of language varieties and cultural knowledge. She posits 
that this will require opportunities for language and cultural 
acquisition, openness, and relationships that make language learning 
worthwhile. Furthermore, these goals will require parental and community
 involvement to extend learning beyond the walls of the classroom. This 
section also touches on the idea that the distinguishing qualities of 
the autobiographies can help to pinpoint areas of need on the island. <br><br>The
 work indicates that there is an opposing pull from globalization on one
 hand and nationalism on the other in Puerto Rico, which has an effect 
on language attitudes. Pousada suggests adopting the mindset of the 
Scandinavian model of “parallel language use” which is accepting of 
language alternation. However, she notes that this type of model in 
Puerto Rico would require significant research, including consideration 
of rural areas vs. urban settings. The work provides a “rough sketch of 
the possibilities for a more nuanced language policy in Puerto Rico” (p.
 154) and concludes that Puerto Rico is a complex linguistic landscape 
that would benefit from a language policy which considers the nuances of
 multilingual abilities and experiences.<br><br><br>EVALUATION<br><br>“Being
 Bilingual in Borinquen” achieves its overall goal of providing insight 
into what it is like to be multilingual, specifically within the context
 of Puerto Rico. The essays explore multilingualism from the perspective
 of understudied speakers who have personally experienced the various 
languages and cultures of Puerto Rico. Well written and user friendly, 
the collection may be of interest to teachers, language policy makers, 
school administrators, linguists, and students. The book briefly covers a
 wide range of important concepts in bilingualism research, gives an 
important introduction to the linguistic situation in Puerto Rico, and 
raises relevant concerns about language policy on the island. Pousada 
succeeds in identifying variables relevant to further language planning 
and policy on the island; however, the majority of the volume focuses on
 the stories themselves, so there is limited depth to the analytical 
discussion.<br><br>One of the strengths of the book is that it puts the 
individual voices of the speakers front and center and lets their 
observations and experiences speak for themselves. By amplifying these 
individuals’ experiences, this publication addresses a push in the field
 to seek data and input from community members themselves (e.g. Li Wei, 
2014) and a surge in research taking an ‘emic’ perspective in the social
 sciences (e.g. Holliday, 1999; Todeva &amp; Cenoz, 2009; Canagarajah 
&amp; Wurr, 2011). A further benefit for readers who are not familiar 
with Puerto Rico’s language dynamics is the introduction to the topic of
 language on the island and the policies and planning behind the use of 
Spanish and English. By including this content alongside personal 
narratives, the book urges readers to consider both the insider’s 
perspective on linguistic experiences and the implications of top-down 
and ever-changing governmental policies.<br><br>The main weakness of the
 text is that the analyses of the narratives remain superficial 
throughout the work. For example, Pousada provides two lists in the 
final chapter–one of factors that were present in all of the 
autobiographies and one of the differences observed–but doesn’t take the
 analysis much beyond the descriptive, leaving the reader to wonder 
about the significance of these similarities and differences. A further 
example is that there are a variety of briefly mentioned ‘themes’ 
identified in the autobiographies (e.g. the role of the media and 
interactions with peers), however the thematic analysis is again quite 
descriptive and these observations remain largely unconnected to the 
research literature. The text offers minimal solutions to problems 
within the field of multilingualism, with one notable exception: citing 
conflicting language attitudes towards bilingualism as a major problem 
in Puerto Rico, Pousada offers up an interesting and intriguing 
solution, the Scandinavian model of “parallel language use” (p. 152) in 
which there is nuanced alternation between languages. Unfortunately, 
this idea is not thoroughly explored in light of the autobiographies 
within the collection. <br><br>Weaknesses aside, the book raises 
potentially interesting research questions, such as the observation, 
“[i]t is remarkable how many times the authors [of the autobiographies] 
mentioned a key English teacher who turned them around or a job that 
made developing their language skills relevant and feasible” (p. 146). 
This question could be extremely relevant for language teaching and 
Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research.<br><br>The longest section 
of the final chapter is reserved for a conversation about language 
policy in Puerto Rico. Here the author writes, “[l]anguage policies 
should ideally emerge from the expressed needs of the speakers; however,
 in reality they often reflect the political agendas of the authorities 
in charge” (p. 148). This is another intriguing point and is followed up
 by the claim that, “an ideal language policy would help individuals 
understand the benefits of bilingualism and biculturalism and transmit 
this knowledge to their children” (p. 151). Pousada then gives some 
general requirements for improvement of language policy: an 
understanding of the benefits of bilingualism, a transmission of this 
knowledge, opportunities for language and cultural learning, an 
open-minded attitude, the cultivation of both personal and professional 
relationships which give meaning to language learning, and involvement 
of both parents and the surrounding communities. Although these elements
 made relevant by the writers of the autobiographies should be discussed
 in terms of the development of future language policy, the work could 
benefit from a practical discussion of steps needed to cultivate these 
objectives. <br><br>Overall, the collection of essays is well suited as a
 pedagogical tool in an introductory linguistics or 
bilingualism/multilingualism class. It provides the much needed 
insider’s perspective for teachers and policy makers whose understanding
 of bilingualism, of lack thereof, shapes pedagogy. “Being Bilingual in 
Borinquen” has the potential to increase general and academic awareness 
of multilingual policies and practices in specific educational, 
political, and social contexts, which could benefit societies worldwide.
 Pousada raises interesting questions regarding personal circumstances 
and language attitudes in terms of both language proficiency and 
language policy and highlights the complexities underlying the 
conceptualization of multilingualism.<br><br>REFERENCES<br><br>Canagarajah,
