<br> Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Lexicography; Text/Corpus Linguistics; Translation <br><br> Subject Language(s): English <br><br> Meeting Description:<br><br> 'Share &amp; Gain' Workshops for Teachers, Translators and Interpreters of Legal English <br> <br>3rd Legal English Workshops, Supraśl, 6 -7 September, 2018 <br> <br>The
 Białystok Legal English Centre, Faculty of Law, University of 
Białystok, Poland is pleased to announce the third workshops for 
teachers, translators and interpreters of Legal English which will take 
place from September 6- 7 2018. The workshops are an opportunity to 
bring together experienced and inexperienced teachers, translators and 
interpreters of Legal English to share their knowledge, ideas and 
experience. This year, once again, we are very happy to host the 
workshops in the beautiful and enchanting town of Supraśl. <br><br> Programme: <br> <br>5 September 2018 (Wednesday): <br> <br>19:00: Welcome Dinner <br> <br>6 September 2018 (Thursday): <br> <br>8:30 - 8:45: <br>Opening Address <br> <br>9:00 - 10:15: <br>First Workshop Session <br> <br>10:15 - 10:30: Coffee Break <br> <br>10:30 - 11:45: <br>Second Workshop Session <br> <br>11:45 - 13:00: <br>Third Workshop Session <br> <br>13:00 - 13:45: Lunch <br> <br>14:00 - 15:30: <br>Visit to the Museum of Icons (optional) <br> <br>16:00 - 17:15: <br>Fourth Workshop Session <br> <br>17:15 - 17:30: Coffee Break <br> <br>17:30 - 18:45: <br>Fifth Workshop Session <br> <br>19:30: Social Event <br> <br>7 September 2018 (Friday): <br> <br>9:00 - 10:15: Sixth Workshop Session <br> <br>10:15 - 10:45: Coffee Break <br> <br>10:45 - 12:00: <br>Seventh Workshop Session <br> <br>12:00 - 13:15: <br>Eighth Workshop Session <br> <br>13:15 - 14:30: <br>Ninth Workshop Session <br> <br>14:30 - 15:30: Lunch <br> <br>The Presenters and Presentations: <br> <br>Our presenters hail from several different institutions and will speak on a variety of topics. These include: <br> <br>How to Motivate Students in a Legal English Classroom - A Communicative Approach to the Teaching of Legal English <br>Izabela Bakota, Jagiellonian Language Centre, Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland <br> <br>When
 teaching Legal English, a teacher must be an explorer, constantly 
looking for inspiring materials and innovative methods to incorporate in
 the teaching-learning process. What we are trying to find is the way to
 go beyond the lesson being merely a vocabulary or text-oriented set of 
tasks. In this workshop, we will test some ideas for engaging students, 
motivating them to participate actively and be involved in their 
learning. The participants will be presented with some practical 
techniques to be used in a Legal English class and will have an 
opportunity to share their experience of teaching Legal English. <br> <br>I Write Further in this Matter: Writing Skills Practice for Future Lawyers <br>Barbora Chovancova, Masaryk University Language Centre, Czech Republic <br> <br>Being
 a skilful writer is a fundamental requirement for any aspiring lawyer; 
legal English courses for law undergraduates should therefore include a 
writing element. Whether designing a course, or just supplementing a 
textbook, these are the questions to be addressed by the teacher: What 
genres are relevant for students of law? How do we select what to teach?
 And, equally important, how do we make writing practice palatable for 
our young audience? <br>Even though the room for creativity is limited 
in legal writing as such, legal teachers do not have to adhere to such 
limitations. An original approach that combines student involvement, 
teamwork, motivation and sense of relevance will be presented. The 
workshop participants will be used as a sounding board for sample 
activities designed to help students to stock on stock phrases and get 
familiar with the relevant templates in an enjoyable way. <br> <br>Wrestling with Tricky Questions in Language Tests <br>Radmila Doupovcová, Masaryk University Language Centre, Czech Republic <br> <br>Proper
 language assessment is a key element in language education. A 
well-constructed test assesses the achieved goals of learning and 
provides valid and reliable information about the students´ language 
mastery and progress. In the workshop we will discuss basic guidelines 
and principles teachers should follow when designing language tests to 
avoid common assessment pitfalls. We will then apply the principles 
while evaluating different legal English test formats. We will examine 
pros and cons of each and verify their validity, reliability and 
practicality. <br> <br>Some Mobile-Assisted (Language) Learning Tools for In-Class and Out-of-Class Use <br>Violetta Jurković, University of Ljubjana, Slovenia <br> <br>With
 today’s access to Wi-Fi networks across the European higher education 
area and ownership of smartphones among the student population, teachers
 of foreign languages can easily use the affordances provided by 
smartphones for in-class and out-of-class language learning activities. 
This interactive workshop will present a selection of tools for in-class
 work within bring-your-own-device (BYOD) activities and a selection of 
tools that can be used to encourage autonomous learning outside the 
language classroom. Using their smartphones, the participants will test 
the selected tools for the mobile-assisted learning of languages through
 activities embedded in the legal English context, and thus evaluate 
whether any among these would be a useful and relevant addition to their
 teaching technique repertoire. <br> <br>Spare Yourself! On Zero (or Minimum) Prep Activities for Legal English Classes <br>Aleksandra Łuczak, Kozminski University, Warsaw, Poland <br> <br>My
 impression is that both the students and the teachers are only 
satisfied when the former leave the classroom with the feeling of having
 worked really hard. Busy teachers are only happy when they do not 
exploit themselves too much and save energy for the whole working day. 
Therefore, the teachers’ objective should be to spare themselves and 
shift the burden of performing exacting tasks onto the students. <br>For
 this workshop, I plan to collect a range of already tested (by me or my
 colleagues) zero or minimum preparation activities to use and reuse in 
the classroom. The activities will comprise pen and paper exercises as 
well as technology assisted activities that students can access on their
 mobile devices. The added value of the latter is the teacher’s growing 
data base of exercises, online materials and inspirations to use in the 
future. <br> <br>I hope this workshop to be inspiring and thought 
provoking both for the participants and the trainer herself. I am not 
going to ask you to do the activities yourselves during the workshop. 
Instead, I will ask you to contribute to the discussion with your own 
ideas on how to further exploit the proposed ideas. All the materials 
will be made available online. <br> <br>(Don't) Bother me with Idioms <br>Agnieszka Pawlikowska, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland <br> <br>There
 is no doubt that law is language. To avoid miscommunication, lawyers 
finally seem to be leaving the realm of language complexities in favour 
of plainness and preciseness. This, however, does not mean wiping out 
figurative language from courtrooms, law offices and even newspaper 
articles. Although idioms convey one meaning, they can be deceitful for 
non-natives and, therefore, can potentially result in misunderstanding. 
Considering the bulk of business done in global lawyering nowadays, the 
knowledge of idiomatic expressions cannot be left to chance. <br> <br>In
 this workshop we will firstly look at different types of spoken and 
written communication in which idioms are used. Then, we will cover 
various activities aiming to make A-Z idiom lists at least more 
digestible for learners. <br> <br>Nifty Corpora: A Practical Tool for Translators in Business, Financial &amp; Legal Fields <br>Juliette Scott, Legal Translation Hub, UK <br> <br>Or in other words… how to make your very own special treasure chest of terminology, in any specialist sub-field you wish. <br>Whilst
 translators have a wide range of tools at their disposal, they are 
rarely trained in the subject field, and they may be unsure of 
correspondence with certain target sublanguage conventions. The 
methodology to be presented seeks to address this shortcoming by 
leveraging the benefits of DIY target language corpora. Participants 
should be able to implement the tool in their work following the 
presentation. The session will be delivered in English. <br> <br>Part 1: Method: compilation <br> <br>How
 to compile a NIFTY corpus: the methodology is not specific to any 
language, so can be adopted by translators working in any language pair.
 It has also been developed to take as little time as possible (e.g. 
around 30 minutes), so as to be useful to working translators. <br> <br>Part 2: Examples of use <br> <br>Practical
 examples of NIFTY corpora: a live demonstration, with plenty of time 
for discussion with participants and questions. How to identify key 
terms, collocations, extracting word lists, etc. <br> <br>All of the 
software involved is available free of charge. A downloadable training 
pack will also be available for further reference. <br>Note: This workshop is not language pair-specific. <br> <br>Persuasiveness Based on Infallible Clarity and Logically Sequenced Argumentation <br>Nadežda Stojković, University of Niš, Serbia <br> <br>Persuasiveness
 in legal issues is of essential relevance for clear lay out of the case
 presentation both in its written and spoken format, as well as for the 
success of the legal case itself. Persuasive legal discourse 
inextricably relies on ultimately infallible, well rounded theses and 
logically sequenced supporting argumentation. Through joint conversation
 in this workshop we will build up a small, representative foundation 
corpus of useful linguistic means that ensure persuasion – approval of 
one’s stance. Using deductive approach, we shall take a statement and 
work on its precision and clarity until there is no room for logical 
fallacies, then we shall proceed to choosing and formulating arguments 
in such a way that they are coherent, well-rounded in elaboration, 
sequenced in such a way that they logically proceed one from another. 
Achieving persuasiveness is founded on appropriate structuring of thesis
 statement and order of argumentation, linguistic means of formulating 
thesis and supporting arguments, but also linguistic signals, open or 
covert, that induce in the listening or reading audience the acceptance 
of the viewpoint the author is endeavoring to put forward. In order to 
come to the most effective conceptualization of argumentation, we will 
practice mock debates in a few iterations – each time an argument gets 
successfully opposed and negated – we shall learn what the weak part of 
it is and on that knowledge upgrade the argument till we come up with 
the most appropriate linguistic and logical tools for achieving 
persuasiveness in argumentation. <br> <br>CLIL Courses for Law Students <br>Elena Vyushkina, Saratov State Law Academy, Russia <br> <br>Designing
 a CLIL course is a challenging task. But an overlap of the main goals 
of teaching a subject and a foreign language simplifies the creative 
process. Developing professional communicative competences is one of the
 goals of a Legal English course. Such lawyer’s skills as interviewing 
and negotiating can be developed and mastered by foreign language 
teachers. So framing CLIL courses in client consultation, negotiations, 
and mediation seems reasonable and realistic for a LE teacher. An 
outline for such courses will be presented. Moreover, workshop 
participants will try a series of exercises used to build up and train 
the skills mentioned above as well as they will participate in short 
simulations which will help them to realise that communicative 
competences and common sense of an experienced foreign language teacher 
are sufficient to develop professional lawyer’s competences at an 
introductory level especially when teachers are ready to self-study. A 
list of resources for teacher’s self-development will be provided as 
well.<br> <br><br>
