The first <br>six chapters contain an introduction to the method and its application to <br>''international German'': the ''Foreword'' introduces Canepari's terminology <br>of ''international'', ''neutral'', ''traditional'' and ''mediatic <br>pronunciation'', related to German: <br> <br>''However, the often capricious behavior of purely native accents has led us <br>to the 'wise' decision to primarily present an 'international' German <br>pronunciation …, in a 'native-like form'. This has the practical advantage of <br>providing an easier access to the 'spirit' governing German phonemics, <br>precisely because the international phonetic realizations are more <br>straightforwardly - yet realistically - connected to the phonemic level than <br>most national or regional accents are. … this 'international pronunciation' <br>has proven to be a good teaching and learning device. In fact, it is still <br>'German German', but with some simplifications.'' (p. 10) <br> <br>''Neutral'' is used instead of ''standard'', ''an impeccably articulated <br>pronunciation which gives no clue about the speaker's geographical and/or <br>social origin'' (p. 9). Canepari gives the following reason: ''because we are <br>convinced that the term 'standard' stands more for something which is common <br>and … 'good enough', rather than excellent and really recommendable.'' (p. 9). <br>Following the author, ''traditional pronunciation … is less recommendable, by <br>now, unlike 50 or 30 years ago'' (p. 9). <br> <br>''Mediatic German pronunciation, in itself, is not a regional kind, rather, <br>something which is not completely neutral, although some peculiarities can <br>coincide with actual regional accents. This pronunciation can be heard on <br>radio and TV, by people who could not achieve neutral pronunciation, starting <br>from localizable personal situations, which have been attenuated (trying to <br>avoid revealing their origin) but with no tangible result. It is something <br>acquired more by practical assimilation than through any learning method.'' <br>(p.135) <br> <br>Having started in Ch. 1, Canepari goes on to discuss his view of phonetics in <br>Ch. 2 (''Pronunciation &amp; phonetics''). ''The phono-articulatory apparatus'' <br>(Ch. 3) presents some articulatory descriptions. It is followed by ''The <br>classification of sounds'' (Ch. 4), specifying into ''Vowels and vocoids'' <br>(Ch. 5) and ''Consonants and contoids'' (Ch. 6). <br> <br>The presentation of German turns in Ch. 7 towards ''The consonants of <br>international German'', followed by ''Structures'' (Ch. 8: ''Taxophonics'' and <br>''Stress''), ''Reduced Forms'' (Ch. 9) and ''Intonation'' (Ch. 10). <br> <br>Chapter 11 offers ''Some texts in phonotonetic transcription'' (where - under <br>others - the famous ''Nordwind und Sonne''/''North wind and sun'' appears in 8 <br>variants). <br> <br>Ch. 12 describes ''Neutral German pronunciation'', Ch. 13 ''Traditional German <br>pronunciation''. Concerning the vowels of these two postulated variants, <br>Canepari assumes only a difference in [ɛ:] (maintained in the ''traditional'' <br>variant) and in the colouring of diphthongs; for consonants there is a strong <br>''traditional'' resistance against assimilation (p. 132). Ch. 14 presents <br>''Mediatic German pronunciation'' with the following restriction: ''Obviously, <br>here we present a slightly idealized normalization. This is necessary, because <br>(as it happens with all mediatic pronunciation, for any language) oscillation <br>between mediatic and neutral characteristics is quite normal'' (p. 135). <br> <br>Chapters 15 to 18 then deal with the variants in ''North-east Germany'' (the <br>area of the former German Democratic Republic), Austria, Switzerland and South <br>Tyrol/Alto Adige. Different from the variants quoted so far - which are <br>subsumed under ''Native accents'', Chapters 19-21 give ''Regional accents'' <br>for Germany (Ch. 19; offering 19 variants), Austria (Ch. 20; offering 9 <br>variants) and Switzerland (Ch. 21; 7 variants, including Italian, French and <br>Romansch areas). <br> <br>In the ''Appendices'' section, we find Liechtenstein, Alsace, Lorraine, <br>Luxemburg and East Wallonia as ''German speaking areas in other countries'' <br>(Ch. 22), ''Some dialects'' (Ch. 23, 15 variants) and ''Some foreign accents'' <br>[of German] (Ch. 24, 17 variants), ''Some diachronic stages'' [of German] <br>(Ch. 25, containing Proto-Germanic up to Middle High German). <br> <br>Chapter 26 provides a ''Mini-phono-dictionary with about 2300 words in <br>Canepari's International German version; Ch. 27 provides ''Phonopses of 26 <br>languages'' and ''principal consonant orograms''. Ch. 28 deals with ''English <br>pronunciation by German speakers''. <br>Ch. 29 offers an ''Annotated bibliography''. The last page of the book shows <br>the IPA chart. <br> <br>EVALUATION <br> <br>Canepari is the author of 7 books of the same type as the one discussed here. <br>For a first 2008 review on Canepari's method cf. <br><a href="https://linguistlist.org/issues/19/19-437.html">https://linguistlist.org/issues/19/19-437.html</a> ; cf. also <br><a href="https://alex-ateachersthoughts.blogspot.co.at/2011/09/english-pronunciation-for">http://alex-ateachersthoughts.blogspot.co.at/2011/09/english-pronunciation-for</a> <br>-italians.html . I regret, but I have to sharpen the critical points found in <br>this review. <br> <br>1. Canepari's model and claims <br> <br>Let us first look at Canepari's model: he criticizes the IPA as being more <br>phonemic than phonetic. A real phonetic alphabet should follow the ''ideal of <br>«one sound, one symbol»'' <br>(<a href="http://venus.unive.it/canipa/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:faq#what_is_natural_phon">http://venus.unive.it/canipa/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:faq#what_is_natural_phon</a> <br>etics_in_what_sense_is_it_natural; FAQ 10) and puts his ''can-IPA'' instead: <br> <br>''Natural Phonetics aims at achieving the essence of linguistic sounds: <br>- by determining their exact articulations through the awareness of what our <br>mouths do to produce them; <br>- by showing them with accurate articulatory diagrams (i.e. orograms, <br>vocograms, labiograms, palatograms, dorsograms), and auditory diagrams (mainly <br>tonograms); <br>- by assigning them appropriate phonetic symbols (which must not be too <br>general with the risk of being useless). <br>What I mean is that even today there is a terrible need for good phonotonetic <br>descriptions, based on a rich set of symbols, as is my own canIPA inventory, <br>which comprises 52 basic vocoid symbols and several hundreds of contoids. If <br>we then consider that there are 8 further potential vocoids, and that taking <br>into account intermediate lip-positions we could get at least as many as 26 <br>more, and as many nasalized vocoids as there are oral, we could reckon with <br>about 1000 linguistic sounds altogether, which are all to be found in my <br>Handbook of Phonetics (HPh), each with its own symbol (generally with no <br>«second-class» diacritics): 500 basic, 300 complementary, and 200 <br>supplementary ones.'' <br> <br>Nobody would contradict Canepari when he states that we should hear to the <br>languages and not do phonetics via written language. But his essay titled <br>''Writing systems: the utmost monstrosity of alphabets and 'orthographies' <br>(<a href="http://venus.unive.it/canipa/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:pdf#natural_phonetics_to">http://venus.unive.it/canipa/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:pdf#natural_phonetics_to</a> <br>netics) shows his illusions concerning his model. <br> <br>The quotation also uncovers the author's illusion of the benefit of a very <br>narrow phonetic transcription. This comprises not only the illusion that he <br>can discriminate the 1000 sounds he defines articulatorily, but also that <br>teachers and learners can profit from these transcriptions. If we took <br>Canepari's ideal, namely ''one sound, one symbol'' literally, we would need to <br>create a symbol of its own for every realization of any sound because no sound <br>equals any other completely. I suppose that not even Canepari would like to be <br>understood in this sense. Therefore he would have to concede his need to form <br>classes. He does this by taking each of his assumed articulatory values <br>implicitly as a class and by presenting the classes by his idealized <br>''vocogram'', ''orogram'', ''linguogram'', ''palatogram'' and ''labiogram'' <br>drawings. Let's compare that to his postulated method: <br> <br>''To be of any practical use in the learning/teaching of pronunciation, but <br>also as a plausible basis for any successive abstract speculation/theorizing, <br>phonetics should be ‹natural›, in the sense that it should be possible to do <br>it without the help of any instruments other than one’s own articulatory <br>apparatus and ears.'' <br>(<a href="http://venus.unive.it/canipa/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:pdf">http://venus.unive.it/canipa/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:pdf</a>) <br> <br>By this practical contradiction of working ''naturally'' and only implicitly <br>assuming classes, Canepari ignores the fact that the variation of vowels is <br>not restricted in a way that would keep the realizations of different phonemes <br>away from each other. He also ignores the fact that the realization of sounds <br>is influenced by coarticulation: in a very narrow transcription he would have <br>to differentiate between vowels framed by different classes of consonants <br>concerning their articulation place, etc. Canepari wants to be seen as working <br>purely phonetically but often states a fixed relation between one of the many <br>sounds he transcribes and the respective phoneme (without describing the <br>phonemic system of the respective variant). <br> <br>There is a basic contradiction between the announced exact transcription of <br>the sounds detected and the apparent normative construction of ''international <br>German'' (cf. above) which is shown by Canepari's FAQ 21: <br> <br>''Do you approve of normative phonetics? <br>I do, however old-fashioned this might make me appear! To me, it’s a way of <br>showing respect to an aspect of a language which is secondary to none. Exactly <br>as people strive hard to use correct grammar and proper vocabulary, why <br>shouldn’t they try to pronounce their language correctly?'' <br> <br>Therefore, as we do not have any audio data, we cannot be sure to which extent <br>Canepari applies a normative or idealizing (normalizing) perspective to all <br>other variants of German, including the dialects, when he transcribes them. <br> <br>A chart of the ''vocoids'' can be found at p. 48; for the ''contoids'' the <br>reader has to consult files NPT 09 and NPT 10 (cf. table at pp. 166-168) at <br>Canepari's homepage. <br> <br>Canepari's FAQ 14 reads as follows: <br> <br>''14. But can you really distinguish between all those sounds? <br>Yes! Many people are able to distinguish a great deal of different car models, <br>including the year they have been made. Of course, they must be particularly <br>interested in cars. When you’re very much interested in sounds, you know that <br>you’re able to feel and appreciate their differences. Try it and see… <br>Obviously, some particular or newer sounds can be more difficult to grasp, at <br>first: a good tape recorder is very important.'' <br> <br>2. Missing data and information <br> <br>However, Canepari does not inform the reader about acoustic text sources where <br>the reader could hear examples of the sound transcribed or check the <br>correctness of a transcription of a certain text. He also does not tell us how <br>he collected the data. This is a crucial violation of scientific rules, as <br>without examples no transcription can be verified. <br> <br>From a functional point of view, Canepari does not offer any systematic <br>distributional analysis of the inventories of the variants of German; there <br>are no contrastive diagrams which would allow the reader to compare diverse <br>variants on the spot. E.g. open [ɔ] appears in ''international German'' for <br>short /o/ while it represents parts of /a/ in Southern dialects. This remains <br>uncommented. <br> <br>3. Narrow transcription <br> <br>One of the central claims of Canepari's approach is: he wants to be ''as <br>precise as possible'' in transcription. This reminds me of a phase in Austrian <br>German dialectology, linked to the name of Eberhard Kranzmayer: there the <br>linguists thought they could systematically differentiate three or four <br>degrees of opening for German dialect vowels. But soon it turned out that <br>variation over generations, regions, persons and contexts (e.g. over different <br>stress of words/syllables in the sentence or different sound context) was <br>bigger than what they believed to be a stable articulation for a certain <br>functional sound, to be transcribed by a certain symbol. What we can learn in <br>general from that example: the narrower the transcription, the more <br>idiosyncratic its outcome will be. <br> <br>Moreover, experience in phonetic fieldwork shows that the single transcriber's <br>practice sometimes causes shifts in the evaluation of certain sounds within <br>the course of a long transcription. Without intense checking of results with <br>native speakers, counter-checking with previous own transcriptions and <br>transcriptions of colleagues it is even hard to use a rather limited phonetic <br>inventory consistently. Here I do not even speak of perception tests or <br>technical aids. <br> <br>Additionally, we may ask what the function of a very narrow transcription may <br>be. Naturally, done previously to the assumption of a phonemic model, it makes <br>us aware of variation related to linguistic or other criteria and by that <br>allows us to create an adequate phonological (= functional) model of the <br>respective language. Therefore narrow transcription, accompanied by technical <br>and perceptual information, delivers important facts about intricate phenomena <br>of spoken language. <br> <br>But we must be aware not to be trapped in the illusion of transcription as a <br>complete sound mapping of any language: transcription aims predominantly at <br>reflecting the quality of sounds, related to their main features of <br>articulatory production (e.g. articulation manner and place for consonants, <br>tongue height, position, and rounding for vowels) or acoustic description <br>(main characteristics; e.g. type of signal, formants for vowels). <br> <br>4. Narrow transcription as a partially normative or idealizing means for <br>the construction of language variants <br> <br>But the situation with Canepari's work is even worse than to be trapped in <br>this illusion: the author uses narrow transcription in order to construct <br>systematic differences between the variants postulated: he wants to prove <br>fine-grained differences between variants of languages - in this book: German <br>- by way of systematically differentiating transcriptions without documenting <br>the respective data. Naturally, there is something which has been described as <br>''Basis of Articulation'' and which allows us to identify the regional or <br>national linguistic background of a speaker. But this metaphor summarizes a <br>lot of factors which contribute to such an identification: besides the <br>specific articulation of single sounds we find suprasegmental factors like <br>forming resonance space throughout articulation, timing, stress, etc. It <br>cannot be shown by transcription as this is mainly oriented to the quality of <br>vowels and the articulation manner and place of consonants and only a little <br>bit to duration and other factors. To give an example: the duration ratio <br>between the accented vowel and the following consonant is very different over <br>the German area though it preserves the main functional difference between the <br>''long'' and ''short'' vowels. <br> <br>Canepari uses apparently idiosyncratic transcription strategies in order to <br>construct differences between the 8 variants of ''Nordwind und Sonne'' <br>(''North wind and the sun'') p. 104-106). I can only give some examples here; <br>the numbers in the columns denote the following variants: 1=German word, <br>2=international pronunciation, 3=neutral pronunc., 4=traditional pronunc., <br>5=mediatic pronunc., 6=ex-DDR pronunc., 7=mediatic Austrian <br> <br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <br>der; dʌ; d[ʁ+]; dəʁ; dɛɜ; d[ʁ+]; dɐ <br>des; dəs; [d+]s; [d+]s; [flap]ɘs; [flap]ɜs; dəs <br>den; dn; dn; [d+]n; [flap]ɘ[n+]; dn; dn <br>ihnen; ʔinm̩; ʔi[m̩+]; ʔin[ɨ+]n; ʔinɘm; ʔi[m̩+]; i[m̩+] <br>von; fən; f[ɨ+]n; f[ɨ+]n; fɔn; fɜn; fən <br>sollte; zɔltə; z[ɔ+]l[t+][ɨ+]; zɔlth[ɨ+]; zɔltɘ; z[ɔ+]ltɜ; s[ɔ+]ltɘ <br> <br>Note: forms like [d+] represent characters used by Canepari which cannot be <br>given in IPA. <br> <br>An inspection of the transcriptions of ''North wind and the sun'' shows that <br>Canepari uses a more or less rule-driven transcription for every variant of <br>German he defined: e.g. the realization of unaccented /e/ is systematically <br>transcribed by [ɨ+] for ''traditional'' and ''neutral'' or with [ə] for <br>''international German'', etc.; as well, unaccented /-er/ is transcribed by <br>[ʌ] for ''international'' or [ɐ] for Austrian; all cases irrespective to the <br>real pronunciation. Respecting the latter, other factors - e.g. formality or <br>position in a sentence - decide about the vocalized or consonantal realization <br>of /r/ in final position; they are valid throughout many German variants. For <br>this reason, foreigners are easily detectable when they try to systematically <br>realize a consonantal version of this /r/. An omission of the vowel is clearly <br>interpretable as regional (e.g. Alemannic). It is absolutely unusual in the <br>articles [dɛs] or [den]. Also the different diphthong transcriptions for the <br>regional variants of German (p. 53) seem to be more or less invented in order <br>to construct systematic differences. <br> <br>There is an overwhelming use of assimilation rules, contradictory to explicit <br>reading or speaking, as we can see from the examples for ''ihnen'' in the <br>table above (the word is followed by a bilabial consonant). Conversely, the <br>glottal stop is inserted almost everywhere in all variants except the Austrian <br>one. <br> <br>5. Phonetically incorrect transcriptions <br> <br>Compared to Canepari's pretensions, there are many systematic transcriptions <br>which are not phonetically adequate, even if we take the perspective of a <br>broader transcription: the realizations of unaccented /e/ in German <br>supraregional variants, often represented by the neutral Schwa [ə], have to be <br>characterized with an open quality, namely [ɜ]. Higher variants as e.g. in <br>some Bavarian dialects show the quality of a reduced closed [e] while an <br>i-colouring (which Canepari postulates for standard variants, cf. p. 136) <br>cannot be found. An a-coloured Schwa [ɐ] represents the unaccented syllable <br>/-er/ with vocalized /r/. <br> <br>Standard German diphthongs are another case where Canepari follows some <br>stereotyped transcriptions without respecting the quality: backward perception <br>experiments show that the diphthongs {eu} and {au} are best transcribed by <br>[ɔɛ] instead of [ɔy] - for Austrian German even [ɔø] - (the rounding <br>disappears in the second part of the diphthong) and [ɑɔ] (both parts have open <br>quality) instead of [ao]. <br> <br>The realization of unaccented /-en/ after /n/ (examples: ''seinen'', <br>''spannen'') by [nn̩] which is - normatively - set for ''international'' and <br>''neutral'' as well as even for ''mediatic Austrian'', is a clear regional <br>variant of Northern and middle Germany. <br> <br>6. Phonological and other points <br> <br>Concerning phonology, Canepari claims that the vowel combinations in German <br>words like ''nahe'' or ''Ruhe'' are ''real diphthongs'' (p. 53) which is <br>clearly not the case, comparing them with the true diphthongs. <br> <br>In his tour de force through German dialects, the author does not give a <br>correct picture, but often uses single features for a specific dialect which <br>are also characteristic of others, e.g. he localizes the vocalization of /l/ <br>in Salzburg and Vienna only (pp. 230, 275), the unrounding of vowels only for <br>South Tyrol. Concerning Bavarian (p. 270), he mentions ''vowel doubling before <br>lenis'' and speaks of ''nasalized vowels and (peculiar) diphthongs''. <br> <br>A historical faux-pas is Canepari's use of ''Danubia'' instead of ''Upper'' <br>and ''Lower Austria'' including Vienna. He may not know that the terms <br>''Upper'' and ''Lower Danubia'' were invented by the Nazis in order to <br>extinguish the name of Austria. <br> <br>I do not comment on the assumed ''phonetics'' of Gothic or Old Saxon, as well <br>as on the foreign accents of German and the ''Phonopsis'' the other languages <br>(altogether 100 pages) as there is no information at all how the author got <br>the respective audios. <br> <br>7. Summative evaluation <br> <br>Summarizing, Caneparis' book shows so many phonetic inadequacies, <br>methodologically questionable shortcomings, basic contradictions in the model <br>itself, or crooked statements (cf. the definition of variants and their <br>evaluation) that it cannot be positively evaluated. Conversely, the readers <br>have to be warned not to take the author's transcriptions as an adequate <br>representation of today's German variants. Adding the sociolinguistic comments <br>on diverse variants and the unclear relation of normative and descriptive <br>factors, the book is a danger for linguists and students to be misled <br>completely when trying to get information about German, phonetically and <br>sociolinguistically. <br> <br> <br>ABOUT THE REVIEWER <br> <br>Franz Dotter, born 1948 in Salzburg, Austria; Associate Professor for General <br>Linguistics, retired; worked from 1973 to 2013 at the Institute for <br>Linguistics of Klagenfurt University, then at its Centre for Sign Language and <br>Deaf Communication.
