<br> EDITOR: Aditi Lahiri<br> EDITOR: Sandra Kotzor<br> TITLE: The Speech Processing Lexicon<br> SUBTITLE: Neurocognitive and Behavioural Approaches<br> SERIES TITLE: Phonology and Phonetics [PP]<br> PUBLISHER: De Gruyter Mouton<br> YEAR: 2017<br> <br> REVIEWER: Maria Teresa Martinez-Garcia, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies<br> <br> REVIEWS EDITOR: Helen Aristar-Dry<br><br>SUMMARY <br><br>The
 book “The Speech Processing Lexicon: Neurocognitive and Behavioural 
Approaches”, edited by Professors Aditi Lahiri and Sandra Kotzor, 
collects various contributions from scholars working on phonological 
processing. This special volume was prepared to recognize Professor 
Sheila Blumstein’s many and sustained contributions to the understanding
 of phonological processing and it stems from a workshop held at The 
Lords of the Manor (Cotswolds, UK), funded by the European Research 
Council. The book consists of an introduction and eleven chapters, 
covering a wide range of topics on acoustics, psycholinguistics, and 
neurolinguistics processing. Each of these chapters has a common aim: To
 provide new evidence regarding how speech and language are represented 
and processed in the brain, outlining the current direction of research 
in the field of phonological processing since Professor Blumstein 
started investigating the speech signal in the 1970s.<br><br>In the 
introduction, Professors Allard Jongman and Aditi Lahiri trace a short 
profile of Professor Blumstein’s activity in both researching and 
teaching, emphasizing how her work has impacted our current 
understanding on how speech is stored and represented in the brain. This
 first chapter is clear in motivating the rest of the book, as a way of 
understanding how Blumstein’s work has influenced our current 
understanding of the field, opening new areas for future research. The 
rest of the chapters in this commemorative volume are all inspired by 
Professor Blumstein’s work, by covering a wide range of topics 
reflecting her interests, models, and methodologies – acoustic analysis,
 eliciting speech production, behavioural as well as neurolinguistics 
experiments – all of which have been explored by her.<br><br>The studies
 presented in this volume vary in their specificity of representation. 
The different chapters in this book cover topics ranging from a more 
episodic approach considering talker specificity in Julia R. Drouin, 
Nicholas R. Monto, and Rachel M. Theodore (“Talker-specificity effects 
in spoken language processing: Now you see them, now you don’t”) to 
underspecified representation in Sandra Kotzor, Allison Wetterlin, and 
Aditi Lahiri (“Symmetry or asymmetry: Evidence for underspecification in
 the mental lexicon”). The invariance and categorization of phonological
 features is touched upon from different perspectives by Professor 
Sheila E. Blumstein herself (“Phonetic categories and phonological 
features: Evidence from the cognitive neuroscience of language”) as well
 as in chapters by Allard Jongman &amp; Bob McMurray (“On invariance: 
Acoustic input meets listener expectations”), Emily Myers, Alexis, R. 
Johns, Sayako Earle, and Xin Xie (“The invariance problem in the 
acquisition of non-native phonetic contrasts: From instances to 
categories”), Joan A. Sereno (“How category learning occurs in adults 
and children”), and Kotzor, Wetterlin, &amp; Lahiri. Vipul Arora and 
Henning Reetz (“Automatic speech recognition: What phonology can offer”)
 provide further evidence for the invariance of phonological features 
(rather than segments) via machine learning. <br><br>The studies 
reported in this book are not “only” limited to speech processing and 
representation in the brain, but some of the research also intends to 
provide evidence for interactions across multiple levels of language and
 speech processing. In this regard, Sara Guediche’s chapter (“Flexible 
and adaptive processes in speech perception”) reviews behavioural and 
functional neuroimagining results that provide evidence for interactions
 across multiple levels of language and speech processing, and Eiling 
Yee’s chapter (“Fluid semantics: Semantic knowledge is experience-based 
and dynamic”) focuses primarily on understanding how semantic 
information is stored and represented in the mental lexicon, by 
comparing how visual and perceptual information is integrated. <br><br>The invariance problem is further discussed in this volume by covering an equally broad number of phonological units.<br>Equally
 broad is the coverage of phonological units covered in this volume and 
which play a role in the invariance problem: variability in segmental 
features (e.g., the variability of cues that distinguish between 
fricative sounds in Jongman &amp; McMurray), duration contrasts (e.g., 
the consonant duration differences in Bengali discussed in Kotzor, 
Wetterlin, &amp; Lahiri), stress and tone (cf. Chao-Yang Lee, 
“Processing acoustic variability in lexical tone perception”) are all 
addressed. Issues about processing also extend to acquisition, 
multilingualism and language disorders, addressing concerns with 
processing phonological information by children (cf. Sereno), non-native
 speakers as well as speakers with language deficits (cf. Jack Ryalls 
and Rosalie Perkins, “Foreign accent syndrome: Phonology or 
phonetics?”). <br> <br>EVALUATION <br><br>This volume is very rich in 
both content, and experimental and theoretical approaches, which are 
presented and discussed by the authors of the single chapters. It is 
important to highlight how the different methodologies and perspectives 
proposed perfectly reflect the very complex topic of phonological 
processing, providing a more detailed perspective on how speech and 
language are stored and processed in the brain of different populations.
 That is, this book is not limited to understanding how one group (e.g.,
 healthy adult native speakers) process speech, but compares them with 
other groups such as children and non-native speakers, as well as 
speakers with language deficits. Not only the variability is found in 
the samples from which the conclusions are drawn, but also on the 
variability of methods employed and discussed (from different perception
 and production tasks, to neurolinguistics, machine learning, and 
automatic speech recognition approaches). All this variability provides a
 broader, more comprehensive perspective on the phenomenon of 
phonological processing and on our understanding on how speech may be 
represented, stored, and processed in the brain. Considering factors 
such as different methodological paradigms or different populations, as 
this book considers, is one of the first steps towards addressing the 
problem of lack of generalizability of linguistics research (e.g., 
Chalhoub-Deville, Chapelle, &amp; Duff, 2006; Krathwohl, 1993).<br><br>Another
 important addition of this book is the importance given to both 
theoretical discussion and methodological considerations, two points 
variously addressed in almost every chapter. It is to be noted that 
before Professor Blumstein started investigating the speech signal in 
the 1970s (e.g., Blumstein, Baker, &amp; Goodglass, 1977), the prevalent
 scientific opinion was that there was no simple mapping between 
acoustic signal and perceived phonemes due to the variability observed 
in the speech signal (e.g., Halle, 1964). This volume is crucial to 
recognize how our understanding on the processing of speech has changed 
over the last 40 years and continues to change. Moreover, the editors 
have managed to include contributions from different authors, not only 
well-known researchers in the field (e.g., professors Blumstein, 
Jongman, McMurray, or Sereno), but also from young scholars, which 
testifies to the interest in this field, the emergence of a new 
generation of researchers, who add new perspectives on the path drawn by
 the experts, and their willingness to address all the open questions 
that still remain in the field.<br><br>This book is, without doubt, an 
excellent compendium of the different models, methodologies, samples of 
participants and data which are covered in the vast field of 
phonological processing. It is rather difficult to find negative remarks
 on this extremely precise collection of contributions. However, and 
personally, I think that this volume could have benefited from a final 
conclusion written by the editors, with a main summary of the topics 
covered by the contributions and a perspective on the work that still 
needs to be done. It is noteworthy stating, though, that the editors do a
 tremendous job introducing the topics to be discussed in the book 
throughout the introduction chapter and that, even though there is not a
 final chapter stating potential empirical or theoretical open questions
 for future research, this is something that is included at the end of 
each one of the individual chapters of the book. It seems that the 
editors worked hard to make sure each one of the contributors did not 
only provide a clear statement of their own research and its 
implications, but also that they state some of the currently open 
research questions that still need to be addressed. <br><br>Apart from 
providing a detailed account of some of the latest findings in the field
 of phonological processing, this book represents a useful manual for 
young scholars who want to open their perspectives on speech perception,
 production, representation, and processing in the brain. For this 
reason, it is definitely a recommendable book for those researchers 
interested in the field of phonological processing, including those who 
are just getting started in research. It not only provides a general 
overview of the field, but it discusses potential open research 
questions for future research and it provides a detailed literature 
review on each of the models, methodologies, samples of participants and
 data that have already been studied in the literature. This detailed 
literature review may be a more than suitable resource for those new 
researchers that need to find the references necessary to motivate and 
undertake their own research. This book is a more than appropriate way 
to pay homage to Professor Sheila Blumstein’s many and sustained 
contributions to the understanding in this discipline. <br><br>REFERENCES <br><br>Blumstein,

 Maria Teresa Martinez-Garcia completed her PhD in Linguistics at the 
University of Kansas in August 2016. Her dissertation presented a 
psycholinguistic approach to understanding bilingual activation, by 
exploring how differences in stress placement between English-Spanish 
identical cognates affect how adult learners of Spanish use stress as a 
cue for word recognition. She continues her research on bilingualism and
 second language speech perception and production while working as an 
assistant professor in the Spanish department at Hankuk University of 
Foreign Studies. Her main research interests include bilingualism, 
second language acquisition, and speech perception and production.<br><br>
