<br> AUTHOR: Chris Cummins<br> AUTHOR: Patrick Griffiths<br> TITLE: An Introduction to English Semantics and Pragmatics<br> SERIES TITLE: Edinburgh Textbooks on the English Language<br> PUBLISHER: Edinburgh University Press<br> YEAR: 2016<br> <br> REVIEWER: Nicolas Ruytenbeek, Université Libre de Bruxelles<br> <br> REVIEWS EDITOR: Helen Aristar-Dry<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>In
 An Introduction to English Semantics and Pragmatics (AIESP), Patrick 
Griffiths (PG) offers an overview of the major issues in the semantics 
and pragmatics of the English language. AIESP has the form of a textbook
 divided into 11 chapters, including exercises at the end of each 
chapter and suggested answers at the end of the book. This second 
edition (originally published in 2006) has been revised by Chris Cummins
 (CC). The book is intended for students in English linguistics and for 
scholars who are not familiar with these research areas.<br><br>Chapter 
1, “Studying meaning”, introduces the basic notions in semantics, namely
 the speaker-addressee relationship, the Gricean picture of 
communication based on the recognition of a speaker’s intention, the 
sentence/utterance distinction, the existence of different types of 
meaning, and deictic expressions. It also outlines issues bearing on the
 semantics-pragmatics interface, and issues related to the notion of 
literal meaning and the explicature/implicature distinction.<br><br>Chapters 2 to 7 deal with the semantic aspects of meaning.<br><br>In
 Chapter 2, “Sense relations”, PG discusses entailment, synonymy vs. 
antonymy, hyponymy, complementarity, converseness, and incompatibility 
relations.<br><br>The semantics of English nouns is covered in Chapter 
3, where an analysis in terms of properties shared by a prototype is 
developed; this chapter also includes a discussion of mass vs. count 
nouns.<br><br>In Chapter 4, PG focuses on gradability and ambiguity of 
adjectival meaning, for which particular features of the context of 
utterance need to be taken into account.<br><br>Chapter 5 is devoted to 
the role of English verbs in sentence meaning, and to the arguments 
required by different types of verbs. Verb meaning is related to direct 
vs. indirect causation, and different ways to classify English verbs are
 proposed.<br><br>Chapter 6, “Tense and aspect”, examines how the English language locates events and the distribution of these events in time.<br><br>In
 Chapter 7, “Modality, scope and quantification”, PG gives an overview 
of the differences between deontic and epistemic interpretations of 
modal verbs. This well-developed chapter also comprises a discussion of 
the semantics of markers of core modality, differences in scope, and an 
approach to quantifiers in terms of set theory.<br><br>Chapters 8 to 11 deal with the pragmatic aspects of meaning.<br><br>Chapter
 8 frames pragmatics as the use of utterances in context and the 
possibility for speakers/writers to mean more than what they literally 
say/write. PG shows how departures from Grice’s (1975) maxims trigger 
different types of implicatures. The discussion of quantity, manner and 
relevance implicatures is followed by a three-page introduction to 
relevance theory, and a section concerning the presuppositions triggered
 by factive expressions.<br><br>Chapter 9 is devoted to figurative 
language. In this chapter, PG illustrates the contrast between literal 
and non-literal interpretations, as in irony, metaphor, metonymy, 
comparison. He shows that the literal/non-literal distinction is not 
always clear-cut and rightly points out that figurative expressions 
increase speakers’ communicative power while imposing extra processing 
effort on interpreters.<br><br>Chapter 10, “Utterances in context”, is 
an introduction to some English linguistic devices used to indicate what
 the speaker takes to be known or, rather, new information. These 
include pseudo-clefts, passives, contrastive focus. PG demonstrates that
 the notion of “question under discussion” is relevant for explaining 
the use of these devices.<br><br>Finally, Chapter 11, “Doing things with
 words”, addresses the variety of social actions or “speech acts” 
performed by uttering sentences. Possible indicators of speech act 
forces are sentence-types, and lexical, syntactic and discursive cues, 
even though none of them is completely reliable to assign speech act 
force to a given utterance.<br><br>EVALUATION<br><br>In AIESP, PG and CC
 convincingly achieve their objectives. They offer an easy-to-read and 
wide-ranging overview of the major research topics in English semantics 
and pragmatics. For instance, their discussions of the major English 
sentence-types in Chapter 2, of the tense-aspect distinction in Chapter 
6, and of the semantics of core modals in Chapter 7 present a lot of 
information in a very clear and coherent manner.<br><br>At the same 
time, the authors highlight important contemporary issues at the 
semantics-pragmatics interface, such as the following: the difficulties 
underlying the identification of the speaker’s intended meaning and the 
extent to which this meaning matches the meaning actually inferred by 
the interpreter, the necessity for the researcher to take into account 
contextual parameters when making generalizations about language use, 
the probabilistic nature of utterance interpretation, and the 
distinction between the rational reconstruction of meaning and the 
psychological mechanisms involved in utterance processing (Chapter 8, 
p.110; Chapter 11, p.145, see also Chapter 10, pp.138-139). PG and CC 
also make insightful remarks concerning the adequateness of theories of 
semantic/pragmatic meaning, suggesting, for example, a minimal semantics
 for imperatives (Chapter 5, pp.56-57).<br><br>AIESP makes a significant
 and novel contribution to the field for two major reasons. First, the 
exercises at the end of each chapter and the suggested answers at the 
end of the book make the book a convenient material for practice 
sessions and student supervisions. Second, unlike, for instance, Cruse’s
 (2011) textbook, it contains several chapters devoted to pragmatics, 
which is more than welcome as there are already many textbooks on the 
market that are exclusively devoted to semantics.<br><br>The structure 
of AIESP is appropriate to its goal. It introduces semantics before 
pragmatics, while gradually allocating space for the pragmatic 
components of meaning in the first chapters, the final four chapters 
focusing on pragmatics. The transitions between the chapters are 
well-thought-out, as in the case of the discussion of scalar 
implicatures following a chapter section on quantifiers and scalar 
terms.<br><br>Another strength of AIESP is that it is entirely in line 
with the times. First, several recent references have been added to the 
original edition by CC, in particular in Chapters 4 and 9 concerning 
adjectival meaning and metaphorical meaning. Second, it is not only 
based on classic theories such as speech act theory, but it also 
introduces more recent approaches such as Sperber &amp; Wilson’s (1995) 
relevance theory. However, unlike for the theoretical aspects, the two 
authors, PG and CC, do not do justice to empirical and experimental 
findings. For instance, Gibbs &amp; Colston (2012) provide an excellent 
up-to-date overview of experimental work devoted to figurative language 
(Chapter 9), but this book is not mentioned in the references for 
further reading; in Chapter 11 (p.149), it would have been relevant to 
discuss Clark’s (1979) experiments concerning the role of different 
sources of information on the interpretation of indirect speech acts, 
but such pioneering approaches (as well as more recent studies) are 
missing in this revised version of AIESP.<br><br>AIESP provides many 
interesting discussions of linguistic phenomena at the interface between
 semantics and pragmatics. That being said, several remarks concerning 
the methodology are in order, in particular if the book is to be used 
for teaching.<br><br>First, PG and CC illustrate their discussions with 
examples, which come early (as from Chapter 1). But all these are 
fabricated examples and, in this respect, AIESP is not different from 
previous textbooks. This is unfortunate because semanticists and 
pragmaticians often face the criticism that they should take into 
account real, attested data from spoken and written corpora. This issue 
is not too worrisome, however, insofar as the book also contains more 
natural and realistic examples in the exercise sections of each chapter.<br><br>Second,
 and this sort of criticism applies to most textbooks, the content of 
AIESP has to be complemented and, in some cases, slightly revised by the
 teacher. That is, several important topics and notions are not 
discussed, such as the differences between addressees, hearers, 
over-hearers, and interpreters (Chapter 2), proper nouns (Chapter 3), 
multidimensional adjectives (see, e.g., Sassoon 2013), polarity and 
markedness (Chapter 4). In addition, sometimes the choice of a term, 
i.e., “complementary”, is not always justified: in this case 
“contradictory” is more commonly used than “complementary” (for an 
exhaustive discussion of these notions, see Horn 1989). Other examples 
of inaccuracies consist in anachronisms: in Chapter 1, exercise 3 
mentions “propositions” but this notion is introduced in Chapter 2; in 
Chapter 5, pp.50-51 it would have been easier for the reader if 
ergativity and accusativity were introduced before the illustrations of 
unergative and unaccusative English verbs; in Chapter 10, p.135, an 
example of a request is “Could you email her now boss?” but indirect 
requests are discussed not before Chapter 11.<br><br>Furthermore, I have
 a few concerns with how the authors position themselves with respect to
 the theoretical approaches they address. To be more precise, their 
theoretical commitments are not always obvious. While they use the 
notion of a “speech act” as a common thread in the chapters about 
pragmatics, they make explicit that they do not endorse a literalist 
view of utterance meaning. By contrast, they seem to assume the 
relevance theoretic distinction between explicatures and implicatures, 
but it is unclear whether this distinction is compatible with the 
insights retained from speech act theory, as in Chapter 9 (pp.119-122). 
Another shortcoming has to do with the allusion to relevance theoretic 
works on modals and the absence of references to Kratzer’s (1977, 1991) 
work in Chapter 7. Concerning relevance theory, I was surprised to see 
that nothing was said in Chapter 8 about optimal relevance and speakers’
 preferences and abilities. Finally, the authors’ treatment of the 
differences between Grice’s “relevance” and the relevance theoretic 
notion could have been more convincing.<br><br>Summing up, AIESP is a 
highly valuable book for anyone interested in the study of English 
semantics and pragmatics. As a thought-provoking textbook, it will be 
particularly useful to graduate students working on these topics.<br><br>REFERENCES<br><br>Brown,

 Nicolas Ruytenbeek recently completed a PhD in Linguistics at the 
Université libre de Bruxelles (2017). In his dissertation, he 
investigates the mechanics of indirect directive speech acts, both from a
 theoretical and experimental perspective. His main research interests 
are linguistic approaches to politeness, speech act comprehension and 
production and, more generally, issues bearing on the 
semantics/pragmatics interface. He is currently preparing a 
post-doctoral project devoted to the processing of im/polite utterances.<br><br>
